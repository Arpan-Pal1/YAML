YAML -> YAML ain't markup language 
Markup language -> Parent child relation

YAML:
    data format used to exchange data, similar to XML, JSON
    (human readable language to represent data)

    *** Store data, not command (Data serialization -> process of converting a data object into a stream and from stream to object -> deserialization)

    Configuration file(docker, kubernettes)

    Benefit : 
        human readable, simple 
        strict nice syntax, indentation is important
        easily convert in JSON, XML
        more powerful representing complex data


Check valid syntax : YAML lint
